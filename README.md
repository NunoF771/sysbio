Code used in the 'Identifying Drug Targets for Staphylococcus aureus using a GSMM' project.
Includes the main notebook (with explanations for each part of the code, also in HTML format with all the outputs),
the script for remote blast (which ended up not being used) and a script (split into 2 parts) equal to the code in the notebook without any explanations (to make it easier to run the whole script at once).
